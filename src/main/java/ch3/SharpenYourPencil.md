# Sharpen Your Pencil

From the following list, choose the statements that would be legal if these lines were in a single method:  
`int x = 34.5;` ❌
`boolean boo = x;` ❌
`int g = 17;` ✅
`int y = g;` ✅
`y = y + 10;` ✅
`short s;` ✅
`s = y;` ❌
`byte b = 3;` ✅
`byte v = b;` ✅
`short n = 12;` ✅
`v = n'` ❌
`byte k = 128;` ❌

**N.B.** We haven't covered all the rules yet and the compiler will always err on the side of safety.
