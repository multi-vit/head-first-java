| Statement                                   | What it applies to                        |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| A class can have any number of these        | instance variable, getter, setter, method |
| A method can have only one of these         | return                                    |
| This can be implicitly promoted             | return, argument                          |
| I prefer my instance variables private      | encapsulation                             |
| It really means "make a copy"               | pass by value                             |
| Only setters should update these            | instance variable                         |
| A method can have many of these             | argument                                  |
| I return something by definition            | getter                                    |
| I shouldn't be used with instance variables | public                                    |
| I can have many arguments                   | method                                    |
| By definition, I take one argument          | setter                                    |
| These help create encapsulation             | private, public, getter, setter           |
| I always fly solo                           | return                                    |
